/*
 * LEARN: the main thing to understand in this implementation is that when linkedlist is created
 * we save the first element in head.
 * after that we always use it to traverse. even to append we traverse from head to tail and add the element.
 * it will more efficient to keep the last element in tail but that is not implemented here
 *
 * key functions to check and understand in this program
 * isCyclic() - uses Floydï¿½s cycle finding algorithm to check if LinkedList is cyclic
 * lengthIterative
 * lengthRecursive

/**
 * Java program to find if LinkedList contains loop or cycle or not. This
